## About the Lab

The UCSF NeuroAI Lab, directed by **Pedro Pinheiro-Chagas, PhD**, bridges fundamental cognitive neuroscience with state-of-the-art artificial intelligence to tackle two interrelated challenges: revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and elucidating the neural substrates of uniquely human symbolic cognition.

Located at the [UCSF Memory and Aging Center](https://memory.ucsf.edu/){:target="_blank"}, Department of Neurology, our lab is also affiliated with the [Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute](https://bakarinstitute.ucsf.edu/){:target="_blank"} and the [Center for Intelligent Imaging](https://c2i2.ucsf.edu/){:target="_blank"} at UCSF. We employ an interdisciplinary approach—spanning cognitive neuroscience, computational modeling, and AI-driven clinical research—to deepen our theoretical understanding of human cognition while enhancing our capacity to diagnose and treat disorders of the mind.

### Director

**Pedro Pinheiro-Chagas, PhD** is an Assistant Professor of Neurology at UCSF. His research investigates the neural architecture and dynamics of human intelligence, with a focus on cognitive symbolic systems such as mathematics and language. Using advanced computational approaches and multimodal neuroimaging techniques, he aims to understand how these systems develop and decline, and how we can help.

### Research Focus

Our research integrates neuroscience with artificial intelligence in two main directions:

- **Clinical AI Applications**: Developing AI-driven tools for diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders
- **Cognitive Neuroscience**: Investigating the neural basis of uniquely human symbolic cognition

We use a combination of advanced AI systems, innovative behavioral tracking methods, high-resolution neuroimaging, and computational modeling to address these research questions. [Learn more about our research projects →](/research)
