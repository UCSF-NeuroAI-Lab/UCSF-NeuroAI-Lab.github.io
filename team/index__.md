      Pedro is an Cognitive Neuroscientist Assistant Professor at UCSF <a href="https://memory.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>UCSF Memory and Aging Center</strong></a>, <em>Department of Neurology</em>, <a href="https://bakarinstitute.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute</strong></a> and the <a href="https://c2i2.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>Center for Intelligent Imaging (ci2)</strong></a>. His research investigates the neural architecture and dynamics of human intelligence, with a focus on cognitive symbolic systems such as mathematics and language and self-referential processing. Using advanced computational approaches and multimodal neuroimaging techniques, he aims to understand how these systems develop and decline, and how we can help. Recently, his team has been advancing the development of powerful AI systems designed to predict and characterize neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions. He completed his undegrad and masters at the <em>Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) - Brazil</em>, PhD at the <em>Sorbonne University - CEA-NeuroSpin (Paris, France)</em> with <strong>Stanislas Dehaene</strong> and postdoc at <strong>Stanford University</strong> with <em>Josef Parvizi</em> at the Human Intracranial Cognitive Electrophysiology Program. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XVsftdsAAAAJ&hl"><strong>Google Scholar</strong></a>. Pedro is also an <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/48288217"><em>endurance athlete</em> | <em>ultra runner</em></a>, ambassador for the <a href="http://ggtc.org"><em>Golden Gate Triathlon Club</em></a> and avid <a href="https://pedrolab.org/"><em>photographer</em></a>.
