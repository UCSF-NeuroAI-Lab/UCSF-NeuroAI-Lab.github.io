<p style="text-align: justify;">Pedro is an Cognitive Neuroscientist Assistant Professor at UCSF <a href="https://memory.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>UCSF Memory and Aging Center</strong></a>, <em>Department of Neurology</em>, <a href="https://bakarinstitute.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute</strong></a> and the <a href="https://c2i2.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>Center for Intelligent Imaging (ci2)</strong></a>. His research investigates the neural architecture and dynamics of human intelligence, with a focus on cognitive symbolic systems such as mathematics and language and self-referential processing. Using advanced computational approaches and multimodal neuroimaging techniques, he aims to understand how these systems develop and decline, and how we can help. Recently, his team has been advancing the development of powerful AI systems designed to predict and characterize neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions. He completed his undegrad and masters at the <em>Federal University of Minas Gerais - Brazil</em>, PhD at the <em>Sorbonne University - CEA-NeuroSpin (Paris, France)</em> with <strong>Stanislas Dehaene</strong> and postdoc at <strong>Stanford University</strong> with <em>Josef Parvizi</em>. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XVsftdsAAAAJ&hl"><strong>Google Scholar</strong></a>. Pedro is also an <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/48288217"><em>endurance athlete</em> | <em>ultra runner</em></a> and avid <a href="https://pedrolab.org/"><em>photographer</em></a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Alice S. Tang, PhD, is an MSTP candidate and current medical student at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Alice recently completed her doctoral thesis in the UCSF-UC Berkeley Graduate Program in Bioengineering under the mentorship of Dr. Marina Sirota at the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, which has garnered recognition by winning first place for the AMIA Edward H. Shortliffe Doctoral Dissertation Award. Her research includes the development of computational methods to yield insights into diseases such as neurodegeneration, cerebrovascular disease, and womenâ€™s health. Currently, she is interested in further applications of computational methods and large language models in complex and heterogeneous disorders within neurology and psychiatry. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=04E4XeUAAAAJ&hl=en"><strong>Google Scholar</strong></a>. Outside of work, Alice likes to explore art, food, games, or tea, and she enjoys going on leisure hikes or playing tennis for fun!  </p>
