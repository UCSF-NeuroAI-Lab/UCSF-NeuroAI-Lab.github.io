<p style="text-align: justify;">Pedro is an Cognitive Neuroscientist Assistant Professor at UCSF <a href="https://memory.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>UCSF Memory and Aging Center</strong></a>, <em>Department of Neurology</em>, <a href="https://bakarinstitute.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute</strong></a> and the <a href="https://c2i2.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>Center for Intelligent Imaging (ci2)</strong></a>. His research investigates the neural architecture and dynamics of human intelligence, with a focus on cognitive symbolic systems such as mathematics and language and self-referential processing. Using advanced computational approaches and multimodal neuroimaging techniques, he aims to understand how these systems develop and decline, and how we can help. Recently, his team has been advancing the development of powerful AI systems designed to predict and characterize neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions. He completed his undegrad and masters at the <em>Federal University of Minas Gerais - Brazil</em>, PhD at the <em>Sorbonne University - CEA-NeuroSpin (Paris, France)</em> with <strong>Stanislas Dehaene</strong> and postdoc at <strong>Stanford University</strong> with <em>Josef Parvizi</em>. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XVsftdsAAAAJ&hl"><strong>Google Scholar</strong></a>. Pedro is also an <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/48288217"><em>endurance athlete</em> | <em>ultra runner</em></a> and avid <a href="https://pedrolab.org/"><em>photographer</em></a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Alice S. Tang, PhD, is an MSTP candidate and current medical student at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Alice recently completed her doctoral thesis in the UCSF-UC Berkeley Graduate Program in Bioengineering under the mentorship of Dr. Marina Sirota at the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, which has garnered recognition by winning first place for the AMIA Edward H. Shortliffe Doctoral Dissertation Award. Her research includes the development of computational methods to yield insights into diseases such as neurodegeneration, cerebrovascular disease, and women's health. Currently, she is interested in further applications of computational methods and large language models in complex and heterogeneous disorders within neurology and psychiatry. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=04E4XeUAAAAJ&hl=en"><strong>Google Scholar</strong></a>. Outside of work, Alice likes to explore art, food, games, or tea, and she enjoys going on leisure hikes or playing tennis for fun!  </p>

<h3>Margo Kersey, B.S. - <em>Research Data Analyst</em></h3>

<img src="/team/margo.jpeg" alt="Margo Kersey" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; width: 300px; border-radius: 5px;">

<p style="text-align: justify;">Margo holds a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and minor in Cognitive Science from UCLA. As a research data analyst at the UCSF Dyslexia Center, Margo leverages advanced computational techniques to improve diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders, identification of specific cognitive profiles, and development of targeted interventions for children with math and reading difficulties. She manages a multimodal MRI database of pediatric participants with a focus on developing customized diffusion tractography to target cognitive domains crucial for language, attention, and math. She also develops interactive visualization tools for clinical interpretation of neurological profiles. Outside of the lab, she can be found at the pottery studio making ceramics, playing with her cats, or sewing. Starting Fall 2025, Margo will be a first year Neuroscience PhD student at University of Michigan.</p>

<h3>Isaac Yi Kim - <em>Medical Student Researcher</em></h3>

<img src="/team/isaac.jpeg" alt="Isaac Yi Kim" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; width: 300px; border-radius: 5px;">

<p style="text-align: justify;">Isaac is a medical student at UCSF involved in various research projects. He currently works on the E*Drive project, translating academic clinical tools for community use, and the UCSF Multitudes project, developing tasks used to identify dyscalculia in children (<a href="https://neuro.iyk.gg/multitudes/">Multitudes</a>) and characterize math cognition deficits in patients with neurogenerative disease (<a href="https://neuro.iyk.gg/mac/">MAC</a>). He also works with the Interventional Radiology Lab, where he analyzes patient imaging and data while maintaining confidentiality. His previous research includes exploring the connection between task-switching and cognitive decline and contributing to a Department of Defense project on situational awareness. <a href="https://iyk.gg"><strong>Personal Website</strong></a>.</p>
